# Cell Phone Price Analys Project #

# Project Description:
This project was carried out to analyse mobile phone prices and to understand the impact of different features on price. The data set used includes features and price information of various mobile phones.
 
# Content of the Data Set:
The dataset contains the following characteristics along with the prices of the mobile phones:

Battery Power: Battery capacity
Bluetooth: Whether Bluetooth feature is available
Clock Speed: Processor speed
Dual Sim Dual SIM card support
Front Camera MP: Front camera megapixels
Internal Memory: Internal memory
Mobile Depth Thickness of the phone
Pixel Resolution: Screen resolution
RAM Memory (RAM) capacity
Screen Width: Screen Width
Talk Time Talk Time
Touch Screen Touch screen feature
WiFi Whether WiFi is available
Price Range: Price range (used as target variable in this analysis)

# Project Steps:
1- Data Exploration and Cleaning:

Data were loaded and basic exploratory data analysis was performed.
Missing and outliers were checked.
The distribution of features and their relationship with price were analysed.

2- Data Visualisation:

Various visualisations were made to understand the impact of different features on price. For example, the relationship between RAM and price, battery power and price.

3- Feature Engineering:

Appropriate features were selected for price prediction modelling.
Necessary transformations and normalisation operations were performed.

4- Modelling:

Various machine learning models were used to predict the price range. These models include decision trees, random forests and logistic regression.
The performances of the models were compared and the best model was selected.

5- Model Evaluation:

The performance of the selected model was evaluated with metrics such as accuracy, precision, F1 score.
Hyperparameter optimisation was performed to increase the success of the model.

# Results and Findings:

RAM and Price: RAM capacity has been found to have a significant impact on the price of a mobile phone. Phones with higher RAM capacity are generally in the higher price range.
Battery Power and Price: It has been observed that battery capacity also has an effect on the price. However, this relationship is not as strong as RAM.
Screen Features and Price: It is understood that features such as screen resolution and width are also determinant on the price.
Model Performance: The random forest model showed the best performance compared to the other models. This model provided high accuracy and precision in predicting price ranges.
